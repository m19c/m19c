I'm a 32 years old Software Engineer from Ostermunich, Bavaria. My journey began when I was 14 years old. In a college in the middle of the
mountains I decided to focus on building websites.
The internet just turned 10 years old, almost nothing was available to kickstart a kid in programming. With a few printed sheets in my backpack I managed to
kick things off.
Since then, the passion never faded. At the moment I am working for Bayerischer Rundfunk (one of the biggest german broadcasters) and Kerngedanke (a social media content management system).
